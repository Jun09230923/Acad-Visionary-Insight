# Acad-Visionary-Insight
We propose a benchmark for complex academic image reasoning tasks: Acad-Visionary Insight, and have released a portion of the dataset. We will gradually release all of the data.

The dataset format is as follows:

{img_path:

[{"Question": "Q",

"Question_type": "Hard Inference",

"Answers": "1. XXX \n 2.XXX \n 3.XXX",

"Image_type": "Image"}]

The evaluation code for the dataset will be released soon.
